												<h3>THE ADVANTAGES OF PROFESSIONALS</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Many of our clients operate internationally. The routines of these organizations or individuals vary from person to person.

												For example, when a senior corporate officers or C-suite level executive travels for work, he or she is likely to fly long-distance during the night, start their first meeting early in the morning, followed by many other appointments. Typically during these business travels, itineraries change due to cancelled meetings or added appointments.
												
												Another typical group of clients is formed by diplomats, ambassadors, ministers, secretaries of state and (even) presidents. Due to their status, they require special needs. The reason for their travels may attract a lot of press. Especially when traveling to countries where certain topics are controversial, think of human rights, freedom of speech, or environmental issues. The hosting country may also attract press thanks to their hosts, which could include governmental representatives, heads of state and royals.
												
												Press coverage by media teams in remote or dangerous environments may also require a security adviser to keep these professonials safe.
												
												The last example group we want to mention is celebrities. The needs for this group require just as much customization as the previously mentioned groups, only differently. Artists, such as singers or actors, who fly all around the world for a concert tour or to promote their latest movie, need protection against crowds as well as people who want to come close just because they are famous..</p>

										<h2>HFRG/PPCT THREAT PATTERN COURSE</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This 40 hour PPCT Defensive Tactics course is for a new instructor who needs to obtain a certification within the system. The PPCT Defensive Tactics System is the first subject control system developed through Tactical, Legal, Medical, and Human Factors research.
										Tactically, the system addresses the most common types of resistance officers encounter, allowing the instructor to maximize training on job-related techniques. Legally, the PPCT System teaches a simple use of force continuum that clarifies the appropriate force level for every level of resistance. Medical research was conducted on every PPCT technique to refine technique efficiency and to ensure the medical implications were proportional to the level of resistance. Human Factors addresses human capabilities and limitations within a specific domain.
										
										The instructor will receive an instructor manual with the latest research done on Threat
										Pattern Recognition.</p>
